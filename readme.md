# Osim - Open Session In Method pattern

A good twin of OSIV - Open Session in Method with no drawbacks.

## Osim annotation

Contains Osim annotation, which you put on method, so that the same instance of 
EntityManager would be used inside the method.

That helps if you want separate transactions within one session.

## ReleaseConnection annotation

Put ReleaseConnection annotation on method if you want to release DB connection 
before the method starts. 

Really useful, if you want to make sure that your code uses connections properly
and not held idle, while application waits for an answer from external HTTP
service.
